## Features

1. **Rich Text Editor** - Letsnote uses `Slate.js` to provide a rich text editor for note writing.
2. **Encrypted Storage** - Notes are stored in an encrypted format in the database.
3. **Sharing** - Users can share notes with others by generating a unique link.
4. **Cross-Device** - Users can create an account to manage their notes from any device. [WIP: Forgot password, and email verification]
5. **Auto Save** - Notes are automatically saved as the user types. (2 seconds delay to prevent spamming the server)
